# ShinyGTS
An archive of old code for Shiny2 which was to replace ShinyGTS and ShinyDTS

I'm literally putting this here so I can safely nuke it from my PC without any regrets.
I don't care what you do with this as it doesn't matter. Nintendo shutdown WFC which this relies on.
And if you can spoof the WFC IP address, you can hack the game. Which makes this redundant.
