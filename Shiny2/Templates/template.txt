Template Files are pre-defined HTML documents that control
the browser output of Shiny². It's very easy to design templates
for Shiny².

1) Create a folder in the template folder and give it a name.
2) Create two HTML files inside the folder: index.html and table.html
3) Optionally, you can create an image called preview.png, but that's for later on.

Good job, you have created a template!

Okay, it's prettty simple to figure out what's going where.

In index.html, you put how you want the page to look.
You also have access to several different macros that
are built in to Shiny²:

$ip$ - The IP address of the person viewing the page
$hg$ - Display the number of sent gen IV pokemon
$bw$ - Display the number of sent gen V pokemon
$mode$ - Display the current mode [distribution/receiving]
$stime$ - Display the current system time [short]
$ltime$ - Display the current system time [long]
$sdate$ - Display the current system date [short]
$ldate$ - Display the current system date [long]

$cgen4$ - current gen 4 file pokemon [only applicable in file mode]
$cgen5$ - current gen 5 file pokemon [only applicable in file mode]

$fgen4$ - prints a table of gen 4 file pokemon [only applicable in folder mode]
$fgen5$ - prints a table of gen 5 file pokemon [only applicable in folder mode]

In table.html, the format is extremely simple:
<tr><td>{0}</td></tr>

{0} is a very simple field. It is the Pokemon name to be inserted.
Unfortunately, more complex tables must be created by hand. This is
the simplest method for Shiny² to understand and work with.
